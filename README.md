# event-loop-delegation

A small demonstration of the event-loop behaviour using Bun.

`server.ts`, contains a simple `Bun.serve(...)` \
`client.ts`, contains a `Promise.all(...)` with fetches to the Bun HTTP server


To initialize the demo do the following:

```
bun install
```

To execute the demo do the following:

```
bun run src/index.ts
```

Check `src/server.ts` @ `ln40` and Check `src/server.ts` @ `ln41` for my questions.

~~ Thanks in advance!
